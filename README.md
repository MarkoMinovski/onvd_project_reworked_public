# Chat-Twist

## A basic chat-app built with Vue and Firebase



This is a rework of my first ever project made in 2023 for the course OnVD 2022/2023
(Basics of Web Design 2022/2023). \
The first version was made with React instead. Also, the helper library [Vuefire](https://vuefire.vuejs.org/) was used


## What does it do?


The app matches you with another random user in the queue and opens a chatroom for you.
Here you can send messages (fully reactive in realtime thanks to Firebase). It is also possible to
view previous chat-rooms (Not implemented yet).


## Where is the git history?

I accidentally leaked my Firebase API keys and had to make a separate repo to show the project. :P
